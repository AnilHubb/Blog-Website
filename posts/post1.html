    <h2>🚀 How I Started Learning JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      When I first heard about JavaScript, I only knew that it's used for web development. I didn’t even know the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I wanted to become a frontend developer, so I decided to start learning JavaScript seriously.
    </p>

    <h3>📅 Step 1: Learning the Basics</h3>
    <p>
      I started with the fundamentals like variables, data types, operators, and functions. I used free resources such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>freeCodeCamp</li>
      <li>W3Schools</li>
      <li>YouTube channels like CodeWithHarry & JavaScript Mastery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It took time to understand how variables and functions really work. I used to write small programs like addition calculators and alert boxes to practice.
    </p>

    <h3>😵 Step 2: Facing Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      After learning the basics, I faced difficulties in topics like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model)</li>
      <li>Event handling (click, input, etc.)</li>
      <li>Asynchronous JavaScript like Promises and async/await</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I would often get stuck and feel frustrated, but I learned how to search properly on Google, and I started using Stack Overflow effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>🛠️ Step 3: Practice with Mini Projects</h3>
    <p>
      To improve my understanding, I built small projects step by step:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To-Do List:</strong> Add/delete tasks and store them in localStorage.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Pet:</strong> A fun project to simulate mood using conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Calculator:</strong> A simple calculator using JS logic and event listeners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These helped me a lot in applying JavaScript in real HTML pages.
    </p>

    <h3>📖 Step 4: Deeper Learning & Real Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
      Once I got comfortable with basics, I started learning about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Array methods like <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>reduce()</code></li>
      <li>Object manipulation</li>
      <li>JavaScript best practices and clean code writing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I also learned how to debug code using <code>console.log()</code> and browser dev tools.
    </p>

    <h3>🌐 Where I Learned and Still Learning</h3>
    <p>
      My main sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>freeCodeCamp:</strong> For structured exercises</li>
      <li><strong>MDN Web Docs:</strong> For deep explanations</li>
      <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> For real-world projects and visual understanding</li>
      <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> For doubt solving and concept breakdowns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔥 What I’m Doing Now</h3>
    <p>
      Now I am building a blog website  using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m learning React.js to take my frontend skills to the next level. I also started solving JavaScript interview questions and making projects to showcase on GitHub.
